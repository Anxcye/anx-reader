# App Store Distribution Exception

The developers of anx-reader are aware that the terms of service that apply to apps distributed via Apple's App Store services may conflict with rights granted under our application license, the GNU General Public License, version 3 or (at your option) any later version.

The copyright holders of app-reader do not wish this conflict to prevent the otherwise-compliant distribution of derived apps via the App Store. Therefore, we have committed not to pursue any license violation that results solely from the conflict between the GNU GPLv3 or any later version and the Apple App Store terms of service.

In other words, as long as you comply with the GPL in all other respects, including its requirements to provide users with source code and the text of the license, we will not object to your distribution of anx-reader through the App Store.

This exception applies only to distribution through the Apple App Store and does not affect any other rights or obligations under the GNU GPL.
